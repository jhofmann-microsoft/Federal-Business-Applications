# Overview

The Government Common Data Model is a collection of data models designed to provide a standard set of tables, fields, and relationships for building solutions for government customers. These data models can be used as a starting point for customer demos, proofs of concepts, solutions, and projects.

The library is designed to work as a cohesive set of modules, with each module representing a specific aspect of government data. For example, there may be modules for managing inspections, assets, training courses, and so on. Each module is designed to be flexible enough to handle different types of data, yet also provide a standardized structure that can be used across different government agencies and projects.

The Government Common Data Model library also was designed to help with system-to-system integrations. This means that as a customer adds additional functionality to their solution, they can integrate with other systems and data sources in a standardized way. This helps to ensure that data is consistent and accurate across different systems and processes.

By using these data models as a starting point, we can accelerate the delivery of high-quality solutions to customers.
